That sucks.  I confess that I usually use Google Maps, Yelp or other apps to do my phone number lookups these days.
But sometimes I'm driving, or walking in a busy area and don't want to be staring down at my phone.
I know, no one calls each other anymore.  But when a call is necessary, GOOG-411 was the best 411 resource out there.
(Not to mention, free.)

R.I.P GOOG-411.  At least one of us will miss you.
