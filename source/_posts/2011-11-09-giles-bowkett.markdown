At RubyFringe '08, Giles Bowkett went on a metaprogramming romp about Ruby,
music, the evils of Venture Capital and the virtues of lightweight, ubiquitous
protocols.  He starts with an impressive demo, but it really gets going about 7
minutes in. Giles takes the crowd on a crazy, lightning-speed tour through 496
slides about Leonardo da Vinci, cougars, LSD and weasel-brained muppet fuckers.

He swears 10 times in 40 minutes, including 7 *fuck*s. They're like flourishes
in an epic fireworks display.

Profanity is like rock music. The f-bomb is electric guitar. You might think it
sounds sophmorish, but if you think it doesn't add energy to a presentation,
you're lying to yourself.

Watch it.
