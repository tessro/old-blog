Tweet embed: Reliability is more valuable than brilliance.

Brilliant people are incredible to work with. Brilliant product managers turn cocktail napkins and whiteboards alive with possibility. Brilliant engineers solve tricky technical challenges with ease and deliver tremendous agility to their teams. Brilliant designers infuse the most complex products with grace and personality. I’ve had the good fortune to work with a number of brilliant people in my career, at Slack, Twitter and elsewhere. They’ve been transformative moments in my career, and taught me to stretch what’s possible.

It turns out, though, that brilliance tends not to be the secret sauce to building great products.

Brilliance is electrifying, but nothing is more invigorating than momentum.
momentum instills a sense of purpose
momentum means more data
momentum increases likelihood of success

Momentum means shipping product on a drumbeat. That drumbeat demands reliability.

"Great artists ship."

In business, success is a team effort. (why?)
competitive edges are fleeting you need a big fast moving team to stay ahead
teams depend on trust
trust depends on reliability
reliability creates leverage

PG has talked about tenacity > brilliance

reliability as a component of execution
reliability forms trust
reliability > brilliance

reliability creates leverage
reliable = manager doesn’t worry about you
you receive less micromanagement
positive emotional connection: giving you things is a way for execs to relieve their own stress, they don’t worry, it gets done

why does this matter?

trust
responsibility
=> promotions
