title: About &mdash; Paul Rosania

<div id="about">
  <p>
    My name is Paul Rosania. I grew up in Rye Beach, New Hampshire.
  </p>

  <p>
    I attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and later Dartmouth College, where I
    graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2005.
  </p>

  <p>
    After graduating, I spent three years in consulting (Ernst & Young,
    Mercatus) and three years in entrepreneurship (Careplace,
    CollegeJobConnect). In its heyday, Careplace was one of the largest online
    healthcare communities, with over 30,000 members.

  <p>
    In 2011, I moved from Boston to Palo Alto, where I worked for a year at a
    7-person startup before joining Twitter in San Francisco. As a Group Product
    Manager, I led the product team responsible for the home timeline, including
    Tweets, Cards, media display, conversations, and other fun stuff I can't
    talk about yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hundreds of millions of people use Twitter to keep up with the world.
    Working on such an important product was a life-long honor.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently a Product Manager at Slack.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I am not working, I am running, bodysurfing or snowboarding, depending
    on the season. I am an avid technologist and spend much of my free time
    tinkering. You can see some of the results on Github.
